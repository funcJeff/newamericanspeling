# How to fix "create"

kreeaet?

bat, bate (new = baet)
cat, cate (new = caet)
bin, bine (new = bien)

So carrying the silent "e" forward:

bet, beat ?
net, neat ?
het, heat ?

I think so.

So the verb is now "to bea or not to bea" ?

So "ea" is the new "ee" ?

What is more popular? "ee" or "ea"  for the "ee" sound?

"ee" is more consistent.

So the verb would be "to bee or not to bee".

Is "create" even using the "ea" dipthong, tho?

So I think it really is "kreeaet"?
