# Can we get rid of "y" ?

# What about YUH sound?

* The "YUH" sound is spelled out in words liec "few" which becomes "fyew".
* Or "YUH" sound in "pew" pronouned "pyew".
* May this is a valid case to save "y" ?

# What about compond vowl soundz?

Like EEE-AAA in "create" and "deviate"

I am not happy with "creaaet". It looks too crazie. Should it just be "creaet"? And "deviaet"? Well, no, I would have to pick one. No homophones.

Should there be a digraph reprezenting the combo sound?

Or EEE-UUU sounds line "beauty"?

I like this breakdown of vowles best: https://englishphonetics.net/english-phonetics-academy/the-20-vowels-sounds-in-English-with-examples.html
